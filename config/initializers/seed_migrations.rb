# Configuration for seed_migrations gem

# SeedMigration.config do |c|
#     c.migration_table_name = 'data_migrations'
#     c.extend_native_migration_task = true
# end

# By default no models are registered, so running seed migrations won't update the seeds file.
# You have to manually register the models in the configuration file.

# Simply register a model:
# SeedMigration.register Product

# You can customize the 'seeded' attribute list:
# SeedMigration.register User { exclude :id, :password }
